nplot2d INSTALLATION

DEPENDENCIES: This code needs plplot libraries. Install them first. They are located in the additional_libs directory. See the corresponding Readme file in the Readmes/additional_libs directory.

First follow the INSTALLATION file to set the bin, man, man/man1, zip, local and tests directories. If you already did it, go ahead.

1. To install the binary and man page nplot2d files execute the command

make -f NagBody install_nplot2d

With this command you will have a running binary and its man page. 

2. Now you may go to the directory

cd tests

and there run the nplot2d code with the default options:

../bin/nplot2d

or

../bin/nplot2d -help

to get the nplot2d help menu or

man ../man/man1/nplot2d.1

to get the corresponding man page.
